* Full metadata system.
* Explicit liberal licences (CC-BY and ODbL) to encourage re-use and facilitate tracking.
* Uses OAI-PMH as a harvest node (metadata is ingested by different portals increasing data discovery, re-use and therefore impact)
* Data has a URI and a citation point.
* CKAN has an API.

## Project Vision

The aim of this programme is to transform our understanding of how sustainable cities can be. To:

* Confront and understand the complex interrelated and competing factors influencing urban sustainability.
* Holistically define, measure and model urban sustainability.
* Identify pathways to transition developed cities and accommodate growth in developing cities in minimally unsustainable ways.
* Define policy and governance structures to implement these pathways in practice.

## These are big goals. 

This isn't just about research - this requires changing patterns of engagement throughout the stakeholder chain.

## Overview of the themes

## Where do we want to be? EDA and Viz

## Theme 4 questions:

1. Can we combine the outcomes from themes #1 to #3 to indicate city sustainability in a comprehensive way?
2. To what extent can remote observations be used as efficient sustainability indicators?
3. Can we use our sustainability indicators in conjunction with knowledge of city form and functioning to identify city archetypes and tailor policy measures accordingly?
4. What are the most effective means for acquiring and managing urban data for monitoring and modelling purposes?

## What about themes 5 and 6?

1. What form should a modelling framework take so that it is adaptable enough to provide answers? 
	* How do we ensure it is directly usable by these stakeholders?

## How do we get there?

The answers to theme 4 questions will become apparent over the programme.

Especially challenging will be how temporally constrained remote sensing can act as a proxy to identify environmental, social and economic characteristics.

In order for any of this to work the *data framework* must be appropriate.

## De-siloing the research process

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/393477/SharedPresentations/20141016_SOC203014_Presentation/Images/silo.png)

## Conceptual modelling

* What are the *requirements*?
* How are the *requirements* articulated and shared?
	* Constrained Natural Language?
	* Ontology?
	* Rule Speak?
* This is multi-disciplinary
	* We must *mind the gap*
	* Semantics may be a big barrier.
* What lightweight *Ontology Patterns* can be incorporated?

## Licensing

This may be an open framework.

* Are there any licensing issues?

## “Science as an open enterprise”, 2012

The Royal Society

Open inquiry is at the heart of the scientific enterprise. Publication of scientific theories - and of the experimental and observational data on which they are based - permits others to identify errors, to support, reject or refine theories and to reuse data for further understanding and knowledge. Science’s powerful capacity for self-correction comes from this openness to scrutiny and challenge.

## The Shakespeare review

This data, to optimise its value to society, must be open, shareable and, where practical, it should be free.

## Open Infrastructures for Open Science

In good science, diversity matters - not only diversity of ideas and data, but also of the people and communities that generate and use the data. Open science e-infrastructure must offer an entry point for all - from every discipline, country, type of institution and background. Never before in history have so many people had jobs supporting, making, doing or teaching science and technology; never before have so many citizens had an interest in science, and a need to understand it. Enabling them is not just good for science; it is also necessary for smarter decision-making as the technical complexity of policy rises.

## EPSRC

EPSRC-funded research data is a public good produced in the public interest and should be made freely and openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner.

## Licences and DRM

* DART used CC-By and ODC-By - Both expect attribution.
* There are other clauses: 
	* SA: Share-A-like
	* NC: Non-Commercial
	* ND: No Derivatives
* Each make the resource less free and have many unintended consequences for re-use and data integration
* Examples: 
	* CC-SA and CC-NC-SA are incompatible
	* Universities and Museums are rarely non-commercial
