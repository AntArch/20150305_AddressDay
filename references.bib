It was developed as a variation of the {OpenPostcode} format developed as a candidate geolocation postcode for the Republic of Ireland.[1] It is similar in function to the original public-domain Geohash code. It is calculated differently and uses a more accurate base 36 (or rather radix 36) representation rather than the original base 32 representation.[2]},
